A master's student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo, I am working with the [Autonomous Systems Lab](https://uwaterloo.ca/autonomous-systems-lab/) under the supervision of [Prof. Stephen L. Smith](https://uwaterloo.ca/autonomous-systems-lab/profiles/stephen-smith). My research focuses on deep reinforcement learning and robotics, particularly in the context of non-prehensile manipulation tasks. I am also interested in the intersection of robotics and computer vision, and how these fields can be combined to create more capable and intelligent robotic systems.

I graduated from the University of Windsor with a BASc. in Electrical and Computer Engineering in 2023 with Great Distinction and a 4.0 GPA. I was a member of the [Human Systems Lab](https://www.hslab.org/) under the supervision of [Prof. Balakumar Balasingam](https://www.singamlabs.org/) where I worked on the development of software to aid in diagnosing common optical diseases using eye-tracking technology.
